# TreeRings

## Overview of project aims:
The Temporal Ecology Lab is endeavoring to build an automated system for imagining and quantifying tree ring data and cellular level wood traits. Building on previous systems, we aim for ours to:
* Move along an x and y axis
* Automatically stitch images (assuming multiple are needed)
* Automatically extract tree ring and calculate distances between rings
* Be flexible enough to quantify samples from a few centimeters in diameter to 50 cm
* Produce images that can be used to count cells and other cellular-level traits
