For all of the movement keyboard controls, you can tap the key once to move a set distance or you can hold it to get smooth continuous motion.
Note that continuous motion works best if you are moving in 'fast' mode.

W: +Y Movement
A: -X Movement
S: -Y Movement
D: +D Movement
Q: +Z Movement
Z: -Z Movement
E: Add sample shortcut
F: Toggle 'fast' and 'slow' keyboard movement. Fast movement has a larger step size than slow. Use 'slow' to focus and center the core.
