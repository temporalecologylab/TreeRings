The Tree Imaging Machine (TIM) is a new open-source scanning tool for obtaining high-resolution scans of dendrochronological samples. TIM extends on the capabilities of the current tools in its class by scanning both increment cores and cross-sections, scanning batches of many samples sequentially, and performing image stitching without user intervention.
