TIM: Tree Imaging Machine

## Abstract (350 words) -- Different from Paper's Abstract

Methods to rapidly digitize samples of tree wood are increasingly needed across many fields of ecology, plant biology and climatology. Addressing this need requires a tool that can scan multiple common types of wood samples (e.g., cross-sections) at high resolutions in a rapid and efficient method. The Tree Imaging Machine (TIM) is an open-source robotic tool to address these needs; TIM acquires scans of both increment cores and cookies at high-resolution (>20,000 DPI) with accompanied software to prepare a final stitched mosaic. 

TIM is built on top of a common gantry machine design with movement in X, Y and Z axes. Using an attached microscope camera, TIM is able to capture images across the surface area of prepared samples. Images are automatically fed into an image stitching procedure to produce a single scan per sample, without the intervention of an operator. Moreover, multiple samples can be queued to be scanned sequentially. Cores up to 80 cm in length are able to be scanned in the standard TIM frame size but can be extended to over a meter by using a longer frame. We believe this open-source device can facilitate the widespread sampling of wood samples across diverse ecosystems and reduce barriers for researchers with tight budgets.

## Explain how your paper is suited to the journal's scope (50 words)

The Tree Imaging Machine (TIM) is a new low-cost, open-source tool for scanning high-resolution images of wood samples, adaptable to other applications. By working on batches of many samples and performing image stitching automatically, TIM makes it possible to easily collect thousands of years of data in one day.
