## Running Head (50 words)

## Abstract (350 words)

### Why did you do this project?

- digitizing cookies at high resolution
- introducing an affordable alternative to existing tools
- introducing a new scanning framework to potentially add new sensors such as IR cameras

### What did you do, and how?

- developed a robot which outputs scans of prepared increment tree cores and cross sections in ultra-high-resolution
- added a camera to a very common machine design: cartesian moving gantry machine
- built a GUI for an operator to interact with the robot
- developed software procedures to auto-focus images, collect overlapping images across the sample's surface area, and stitch the images into a mosaic

### What are the advantages of the method / apparatus?

- the machine frame can be made larger relatively affordably to account for long core samples
- batches of multiple samples can be set at once, allowing most of the running time of the robot to not need human intervention
- includes stitching on the device without the transferring images
- a configuration file allows the operator to adjust the DPI of output stitch

### How well does it work?

- the machine can stitch images over 20,000 DPI //Find exact value
- a theoretical maximum core length would be over a meter //Find exact value
- a maximum cookie cross section would be a few centimeters //find exact value

The Tree Imaging Machine (TIM) is an open-source scanning robot designed to obtain high-resolution (>20,000 DPI) digital scans of wood samples. The TIM design is budget conscious without compromising on quality of scan or convenience of operation.

TIM is built on top of a common gantry machine design with movement in X, Y and Z axes. Using an attached microscope camera, TIM captures images of the surface area of prepared tree cores and cross-sections (cookies). Images are automatically fed into an image stitching procedure to produce a single scan per sample, without the intervention of an operator. Moreover, multiple samples can be queued to be scanned sequentially.

A common issue with scanning tools is the maximum sample size that can be scanned. TIM has the ability to scan cores up to 80 cm in length.

## Explain how your paper is suited to the journal's scope (50 words)

The Tree Imaging Machine (TIM) is a new open-source scanning tool for obtaining high-resolution scans of dendrochronological samples. TIM extends on the capabilities of the current tools in its class by scanning both increment cores and cross-sections, scanning batches of many samples sequentially, and performing image stitching without user intervention.


### Journal's Scope
