	abstract = {Standard procedures to obtain high-quality images of wood samples have become a bottleneck in the digitization of dendrochronology. Digitization is currently dominated by flatbed scanners, but the use of these devices is limited by sample length and surface flatness. Although several solutions based on digital photography have been published, they lack effective digitization processes or are too expensive to be widely adopted. Free open-source software and hardware has emerged as an alternative to create research tools that combine reduced costs with high reliability. Here we present CaptuRING, an open-source tool for wood sample digitization combining a do-it-yourself hardware based on Arduino® with a DSLR camera and a free open-source software with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. We compared CaptuRing with image acquisition from a standard flatbed scanner Epson® V750PRO. CaptuRING outperforms scanner image resolution and sharpness, while it removes sample size limitations. Moreover, CaptuRing performs this task in less than half of the time needed by Epson® V750PRO flatbed scanner. CaptuRING emerges as a reliable and low-cost tool to capture high-resolution images of wood samples boosting current digitization processes. The combination of free open software and hardware empowers dendrochronology to advance in wood sample digitization.},

Images derived from the ATRICS program and processed in any of the available programs for automatic tree-ring recognition are of much higher detail than those from flatbed scanners, as optical magnification has many advantages over digital magnification (especially in areas with extremely narrow tree rings). The quality of stitching was tested using visual assessment - no blurred areas were detected between adjacent images and no tree rings were missing because of the stitching procedure. A test for distortion showed no differences between the original and captured square, indicating that the captured images are distortion free. Differences between manual and automatic measurement are statistically insignificant. The processing of very long cores also poses no problems.},

This procedure takes advantage of the technological developments in computing, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS) to overcome the technical limitations of the currently used methods. Two types of wood samples can be used (stem disks and/or bars) depending on tree diameter, and the difficulty of ring delineation and crossdating. Bars are an effective compromise between cores and disks. We developed an application combining several programs (Excel, R, ArcGIS, and MapWinGIS) in the Windows operating system for semi-automatic measurement of tree-rings from high-resolution images of the sanded cross-section. Using an innovative method to reverse the wood shrinkage resulting from the drying process, tree-ring measurement can be performed on shrinkage-free images, thus referring to the actual growth of the tree.},

	abstract = {Eastern Australia is known to experience multi-decadal periods of flood and drought. Subtropical Southeast Queensland is one region where these devastating extreme events occur regularly yet a full understanding of their frequency and magnitude cannot be determined from the short duration ({\textless}100 years) climate data available for the region. Tree-rings are a potential source of long-term ({\textgreater}100 years) proxy rainfall information but locating suitable forest stands is difficult due to extensive land clearing by European settlers. Another factor deterring the use of trees as proxy data sources is that longer-lived species frequently contain anomalous rings, particularly faint rings, hindering their use for paleoclimate study. Here we present a method which overcomes the problems of identifying faint ring boundaries in trees by using X-radiographs and density patterns developed on the Itrax core scanner. We analysed 39 tree cores from 20 trees at a site in D'Aguilar National Park located just north of Brisbane city in Queensland, Australia. Each core had a 2 mm lath cut perpendicular to its rings which was then passed through an Itrax core scanner. The tree-ring boundaries were identified on the image by both the visual features in the radiograph and the change in density observed between rings. From this information we developed a tree-ring chronology. The chronology was checked using bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating on five trees to confirm the annual nature of the rings, and to correct dating errors in the chronology due to false rings which are common in this species. Climate response function analysis showed Austral annual rainfall (June–May) was the dominant environmental variable driving tree growth. Finally, a 69-year statistically significant reconstruction of Brisbane precipitation was produced showing that this non-destructive Itrax ring identification technique together with age validation by bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating is useful for dendroclimatological studies of trees with faint ring boundaries.},

Archiving digital images of wood samples in libraries, which have been developed for ecological analysis and are publicly available, remains the exception. We developed the Wood Image Analysis and Dataset (WIAD), an open-source application including a web interface to integrate basic visual analysis of wood samples, such as increment cores, thin sections or X-ray films, basic data processing, and archiving of the images and derived data to facilitate transparency and reproducibility in studies using visual characteristics of wood. WIAD provides user-friendly tools to manipulate images of wood samples, mark and measure wood characteristics such as growth increments, density fluctuations, early- and latewood widths and fire scars, and to visualise, process and archive images, metadata, and the derived data.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The recent developments in artificial intelligence have the potential to facilitate new research methods in ecology. Especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been shown to outperform other approaches in automatic image analyses. Here we apply a DCNN to facilitate quantitative wood anatomical (QWA) analyses, where the main challenges reside in the detection of a high number of cells, in the intrinsic variability of wood anatomical features, and in the sample quality. To properly classify and interpret features within the images, DCNNs need to undergo a training stage. We performed the training with images from transversal wood anatomical sections, together with manually created optimal outputs of the target cell areas. The target species included an example for the most common wood anatomical structures: four conifer species; a diffuse-porous species, black alder ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Alnus glutinosa{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} L.); a diffuse to semi-diffuse-porous species, European beech ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Fagus sylvatica{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} L.); and a ring-porous species, sessile oak ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Quercus petraea{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} Liebl.). The DCNN was created in Python with Pytorch, and relies on a Mask-RCNN architecture. The developed algorithm detects and segments cells, and provides information on the measurement accuracy. To evaluate the performance of this tool we compared our Mask-RCNN outputs with U-Net, a model architecture employed in a similar study, and with ROXAS, a program based on traditional image analysis techniques. First, we evaluated how many target cells were correctly recognized. Next, we assessed the cell measurement accuracy by evaluating the number of pixels that were correctly assigned to each target cell. Overall, the “learning process” defining artificial intelligence plays a key role in overcoming the issues that are usually manually solved in QWA analyses. Mask-RCNN is the model that better detects which are the features characterizing a target cell when these issues occur. In general, U-Net did not attain the other algorithms’ performance, while ROXAS performed best for conifers, and Mask-RCNN showed the highest accuracy in detecting target cells and segmenting lumen areas of angiosperms. Our research demonstrates that future software tools for QWA analyses would greatly benefit from using DCNNs, saving time during the analysis phase, and providing a flexible approach that allows model retraining.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The limited field of view of high-resolution microscopic images hinders the study of biological samples in a single shot. Stitching of microscope images (tiles) captured by the whole-slide imaging (WSI) technique solves this problem. However, stitching is challenging due to the repetitive textures of tissues, the non-informative background part of the slide, and the large number of tiles that impact performance and computational time. To address these challenges, we proposed the Fast and Robust Microscopic Image Stitching (FRMIS) algorithm, which relies on pairwise and global alignment. The speeded up robust features (SURF) were extracted and matched within a small part of the overlapping region to compute the transformation and align two neighboring tiles. In cases where the transformation could not be computed due to an insufficient number of matched features, features were extracted from the entire overlapping region. This enhances the efficiency of the algorithm since most of the computational load is related to pairwise registration and reduces misalignment that may occur by matching duplicated features in tiles with repetitive textures. Then, global alignment was achieved by constructing a weighted graph where the weight of each edge is determined by the normalized inverse of the number of matched features between two tiles. FRMIS has been evaluated on experimental and synthetic datasets from different modalities with different numbers of tiles and overlaps, demonstrating faster stitching time compared to existing algorithms such as the Microscopy Image Stitching Tool (MIST) toolbox. FRMIS outperforms MIST by 481\% for bright-field, 259\% for phase-contrast, and 282\% for fluorescence modalities, while also being robust to uneven illumination.},

	abstract = {Stitching of microscopic images is a technique used to combine multiple overlapping images (tiles) from biological samples with a limited field of view and high resolution to create a whole slide image. Image stitching involves two main steps: pairwise registration and global alignment. Most of the computational load and the accuracy of the stitching algorithm depend on the pairwise registration method. Therefore, choosing an efficient, accurate, robust, and fast pairwise registration method is crucial in the whole slide imaging technique. This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of different pairwise registration techniques in terms of execution time and quality. These techniques included feature-based methods such as Harris, Shi-Thomasi, FAST, ORB, BRISK, SURF, SIFT, KAZE, MSER, and deep learning-based SuperPoint features. Additionally, region-based methods were analyzed, which were based on the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and the combination of phase correlation and NCC. Investigations have been conducted on microscopy images from different modalities such as bright-field, phase-contrast, and fluorescence. The feature-based methods were highly robust to uneven illumination in tiles. Moreover, some features were found to be more accurate and faster than region-based methods, with the SURF features identified as the most effective technique. This study provides valuable insights into the selection of the most efficient and accurate pairwise registration method for creating whole slide images, which is essential for the advancement of computational pathology and biology.},

	abstract = {Automatic focusing of a digital camera in live preview mode, where the camera’s display screen is used as a viewﬁnder, is done through contrast detection. In focusing using contrast detection, a focus measure is used to map an image to a value that represents the degree of focus of the image. Many focus measures have been proposed and evaluated in the literature. However, previous studies on focus measures have either used a small number of benchmarks images in their evaluation, been directed at microscopy and not digital cameras, or have been based on ad hoc evaluation criteria. In this paper, we perform an extensive empirical evaluation of focus measures for digital photography and advocate using three standard statistical measures of performance—precision, recall, and mean absolute error—as evaluation criteria. Our experimental results indicate that (i) some popular focus measures perform poorly when applied to autofocusing in digital photography, and (ii) simple focus measures based on taking the ﬁrst derivative of an image perform exceedingly well in digital photography.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Stitching microscope images into a mosaic is an essential step in the analysis and visualization of large biological specimens, particularly human and animal tissues. Recent approaches to highly multiplexed imaging generate high-plex data from sequential rounds of lower-plex imaging. These multiplexed imaging methods promise to yield precise molecular single-cell data and information on cellular neighborhoods and tissue architecture. However, attaining mosaic images with single-cell accuracy requires robust image stitching and image registration capabilities that are not met by existing methods.
RESULTS: We describe the development and testing of ASHLAR, a Python tool for coordinated stitching and registration of 103 or more individual multiplexed images to generate accurate whole-slide mosaics. ASHLAR reads image formats from most commercial microscopes and slide scanners, and we show that it performs better than existing open-source and commercial software. ASHLAR outputs standard OME-TIFF images that are ready for analysis by other open-source tools and recently developed image analysis pipelines.

	abstract = {Stitching partially overlapping image tiles into a montage is a common requirement for materials microscopy. We developed ITKMontage, a new module for the open-source Insight Toolkit (ITK), capable of robustly and quickly generating extremely large, high-bit-depth montages within the memory constraints of standard workstations. The phase correlation method is at the core of our pairwise tile registration algorithm. Precise alignment of tiles acquired in typical raster patterns is enhanced with sub-pixel fitting and cropping to overlap. Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based correlation is improved through a variety of padding methods and an added adjustable bias toward an expected translation. To arrange the tiles into the overall montage, we use global least squares minimization with outlier detection and removal. To blend tiles smoothly, each tile’s contribution is weighted by the distance from the tile’s edge. Results are demonstrated on several material science data sets and 3D images. Results compare favorably to ImageJ/Fiji plugin Image Stitching. The tool is integrated into the DREAM.3D software suite for multidimensional, multimodal microstructural data.},

Currently, there are many mineralogical analysis methods, but the problem is that analysis equipment is expensive and in-situ analysis is not possible. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed an in-situ mineralogical analysis method using a relatively inexpensive handheld microscope. At this time, image stitching was applied to solve the inconvenience of observation due to the small field of view of the microscope. Experiments using a ferruginous quartzite ore confirmed that this method is very useful for immediate mineralogical analysis and detection of interesting areas for more detailed analysis. The algorithm suggested in this paper can be applied to the development of a dedicated mineralogical analysis system in future.},

Manual measurements of annual growth rings in trees are slow, labour-intensive and subject to human bias, hindering the generation of big datasets. We present an alternative, neural network-based implementation that automates detection and measurement of tree-ring boundaries from coniferous species. We trained our Mask R-CNN extensively on over 8000 manually annotated ring boundaries from microscope-imaged Norway Spruce Picea abies increment cores. We assessed the performance of the trained model after post-processing on real-world data generated from our core processing pipeline. The CNN after post-processing performed well, with recognition of over 98\% of ring boundaries (recall) with a precision in detection of 96\% when tested on real-world data. Additionally, we have implemented automatic measurements based on minimum distance between rings. With minimal editing for missed ring detections, these measurements were 98\% correlated with human measurements of the same samples. Tests on other three conifer species demonstrate that the CNN generalizes well to other species with similar structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of automating the measurement of growth increment in tree core samples. Our CNN-based system provides high predictive performance in terms of both tree-ring detection and growth rate determination. Our application is readily deployable as a Docker container and requires only basic command line skills. Additionally, an easy re-training option allows users to expand capabilities to other wood types. Application outputs include both editable annotations of predictions as well as ring-width measurements in a commonly used .pos format, facilitating the efficient generation of large ring-width measurement datasets from increment core samples, an important source of environmental data.},
